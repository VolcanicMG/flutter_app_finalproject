Getting to know me. Who is Ethan Hoff? On this page I will be talking about myself, and more info about me as an individual. 
People that know me well, have noticed that I have a chip adiction.Sports have always been a huge part of my life. 
Participating in backetball when I was younge, to growing up in soccer. 
My journey in sports has taught me alot. Working as a team is extreamly important, 
and getting to know your teamates is an experience of a lifetime.
Iv'e worked ever since I could. I had many jobs, being a carpenter, youtube, and working for SCA. 
Iv'e worked for my dad laying down carpet and flooring since I was around 15. 
One day my dad's good friend asked me if I would like to be an intern for SCA as a worker at the boat check station. 
Long story short, I said sure and got started on that adventure.
